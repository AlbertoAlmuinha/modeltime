# modeltime

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

A scalable time series forecasting toolset that **combines classical
algorithms and machine learning into 1 framework.**

## Features & Benefits

Modeltime has a few key features and benefits:

1.  **Interactive Plotting by default** - Modeling algorithms have
    strengths and weaknesses that come to light when visualized
    interactively.
2.  **Use Classical Algorithms and Machine Learning Algorithms
    together** - No need to switch back and forth between various
    frameworks. `modeltime` unlocks machine learning & classical time
    series analysis.

## Tutorials

  - Getting Started - A walkthrough of the 6-Step Process for using
    `modeltime` to forecast

## Installation

Install the development version from with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("business-science/modeltime")
```
