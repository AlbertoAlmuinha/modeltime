# modeltime

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A scalable time series forecasting framework and workflow for use with the `tidymodels` ecosystem.

## Features & Benefits

Modeltime has a few key features and benefits:

1. __Interactive Plotting by default__ - Modeling algorithms have strengths and weaknesses that come to light when visualized interactively. 
2. __Use Classical Algorithms and Machine Learning Algorithms together__ - No need to switch back and forth between various frameworks. `modeltime` unlocks machine learning & classical time series analysis. 

## ARIMA Example

Load libraries.

```{r}
library(modeltime)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(timetk)
library(parsnip)
library(rsample)
```

### Step 1 - Collect data and split into training and test sets. 

```{r}
# Data
m750 <- m4_monthly %>% filter(id == "M750")

# Split Data 80/20
splits <- initial_time_split(m750, prop = 0.9)
```


### Step 2 - Fit Models

Fit ARIMA models to a training set. We have included some classic time series models and some new boosted versions:

- __Auto ARIMA__ (see `arima_reg()`)
- __Auto ARIMA + XGBoost__ - XGBoosted ARIMA Errors! (see `arima_boost()`)

```{r, message = F}
# Model 1: auto_arima ----
model_fit_no_boost <- arima_reg() %>%
    set_engine(engine = "auto_arima") %>%
    fit(value ~ date, data = training(splits))

# Model 2: arima_boost ----
model_fit_boosted <- arima_boost(
    min_n = 2,
    learn_rate = 0.015
) %>%
    set_engine(engine = "auto_arima_xgboost") %>%
    fit(value ~ date + as.numeric(date) + month(date, label = TRUE),
        data = training(splits))
```

### Step 3 - Add fitted models to a Model Table. 

Add as many models as you'd like. The analysis scales with multiple models. 

```{r, paged.print = FALSE}
models_tbl <- modeltime_table(
    model_fit_no_boost,
    model_fit_boosted
)

models_tbl
```

### Step 4 - Calibrate the model to a training set. 

Calibrating adds a new column, `.calibration_data`, with the test predictions and residuals inside. This is how confidence intervals and accuracy metrics are determined from out-of-sample predictions.

```{r, paged.print = FALSE}
calibration_tbl <- models_tbl %>%
    modeltime_calibrate(new_data = testing(splits))

calibration_tbl
```

### Step 5 - Forecast vs Testing Set

Visualizing the Test Error is easy to do. And you get an out-of-sample confidence interval. 

```{r}
calibration_tbl %>%
    modeltime_forecast(
        new_data    = testing(splits),
        actual_data = m750
    ) %>%
    plot_modeltime_forecast(.interactive = FALSE)
```

### Step 6 - Refit to Full Dataset & Forecast Forward

```{r, message=F, paged.print = FALSE}
refit_tbl <- calibration_tbl %>%
    modeltime_refit(data = m750)

refit_tbl %>%
    modeltime_forecast(h = "3 years", actual_data = m750) %>%
    plot_modeltime_forecast(.interactive = FALSE)
```
