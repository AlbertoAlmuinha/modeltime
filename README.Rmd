## Features & Benefits


#### Modeltime unlocks time series models and machine learning in 1 framework 


No need to switch back and forth between various frameworks. `modeltime` unlocks machine learning & classical time series analysis.

  - `forecast`: Use ARIMA, ETS, and more models coming. 
  - `prophet`: Use Facebook's `prophet()` algorithm
  - `tidymodels`: Use any `parsnip` model: `rand_forest()`, Boosted `boost_tree()`, `linear_reg()`, `mars()`, `svm_rbf()` to forecast 

#### A streamlined workflow for forecasting

Modeltime incorporates a [simple workflow (see Getting Started with Modeltime)](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/articles/getting-started-with-modeltime.html) for using best practices to forecast.

#### Interactive plotting by default

All plots incorporate both `plotly` (interactive) and `ggplot2` (static) visualizations. This means you can quickly add forecasts to `shiny` apps, `rmarkdown` documents, and more.
